# SWS3025
NUS SWS3025 project

## What have we done

A white cane system for assisting visually impaired individuals when going out.

* It utilizes cameras and sensors to monitor the environment 
* It employs machine learning algorithms to predict the weather
* It recognize traffic lights and crosswalks to aid in travel.
 
Featuring an intelligent voice assistant for independent taxi-hailing, navigation, time and weather inquiries, this cane is also equipped with motors for automatic traction.

(All code on the raspberry Pi shouldbe run in the virtual environment.)

## Future prospects

Due to hardware limitation, we couldn't perform PCB soldering.
So you can see our DuPont lines flying everywhere.

And speaking of systematic design, we use HTTP
 as general communication method.So if you want to dive into embedded zone, 
you should learn about MQTT stuffs...

Last but not least, our project is more like a toy and intro, 
if anyone who is interested in our project 
and has ambitions to make the product better, 
we will be very privileged:)
